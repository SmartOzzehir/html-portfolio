<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Finance Manager, Financial Controller and Tax Auditor, I have gained extensive experience in tax auditing, financial reporting, and accounting. </p>

<p>During my tenure at EY as a Senior Tax Auditor, I provided tax consultancy services to local and international firms and reported possible tax risks and opportunities. My expertise also includes planning, managing, and rendering tax audits, preparing yearly tax certification reports, and ensuring compliance with local legislation, double tax treaties, and global tax guidance.</p>

<p>Additionally, my experience as a Finance Manager and Financial Controller has equipped me with the skills necessary to monitor financial closing processes, prepare monthly financial reports, analyse and report company KPI results, and prepare and monitor annual budget plans.</p>

<p>I hold a BSc in Economics from Hacettepe University and possess excellent communication, collaboration, critical thinking, problem-solving, and active listening skills. My proficiency in Microsoft Office, SAP-BFC, and SOX Audit has enabled me to efficiently prepare, analyse, and interpret periodic internal-external reports accurately and in a timely manner.</p>
